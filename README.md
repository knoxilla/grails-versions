grails-versions

Handy repo/script to compare fresh `create-app` versions of Grails 3, 4, and 5 so you can see what changed.

All hail [Eric Helgeson](https://github.com/erichelgeson/) for the original repo/script! Carried on here after after that repo was archived. I wanted to keep on tracking changes between Grails 4 & 5, hence this continuation.

Just compare across tags:
* <https://github.com/knoxilla/grails-versions/compare/3.0.10...3.1.8>
* <https://github.com/knoxilla/grails-versions/compare/3.2.0...3.2.11>
* <https://github.com/knoxilla/grails-versions/compare/3.3.9...4.0.3>
* <https://github.com/knoxilla/grails-versions/compare/4.0.12...5.0.0>

Or from the git cli:

```bash
git diff 4.0.12..5.0.0
```
